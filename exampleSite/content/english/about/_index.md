Hello! I am Priyanka Pachpande, an independent illustrator and entrepreneur based in Pune. I graduated from Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design and Technology (Bangalore) in 2018. 
I started my journey as an independent designer in 2020 and have had the privilege to work on a wide range of projects. I have illustrated for about 10 books and book covers, including 4 for Dr Sudha Murty, illustrated across industries like fashion and advertising, digital invites and more! I hope that you feel joy and magic, a deep dive in to another world, when you experience my work. 

My own ‘Chamki & Co’ is a line of illustrated products for making your every day stylish and super organised! You can browse through our products here.


I am happy to share that my illustration work has been featured in The Indian Express, The Hindu, Times Of India, The Telegraph, Mint Lounge, Paper Planes.

If you have brilliant idea that I could help skyrocket, I am all ears! Get in touch here.
